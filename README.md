# Welcome to CISC181!

*Yes, we are using TypeScript for CISC181 this semester! :-)*

## Environment Set-Up
There are a few things you need to have installed and set up prior to the first lab (where you will be explaining Git and assisting students with setup)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): The IDE we will be using in this course is VS Code. It's okay if you prefer another IDE for personal use, but please download and familiarize yourself with VS Code for this course. You will also need a few extensions:
    - ESLint Extension: Code linter
    - Prettier Extension: Code formatter
    - [Guide for adding extensions on VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#:~:text=You%20can%20browse%20and%20install,on%20the%20VS%20Code%20Marketplace.)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/): Make sure you have the latest version of Node installed.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git): You *really* should already have this and be familiar with Git, but here is the link just so you know we're using it.

For this repository, if you plan on completing the practice problems and running tests, make sure to `npm install` to run tests with `npm run test`

## I'm New To TypeScript
If you are new to TypeScript, please take some time before the semester begins to familiarize yourself with it. Luckily, that's what this repo is here for!
A lot of the *content* of this course will be similar to what you learned when CISC181 was taught with Java; you should already know OOP.
To get started...
1. Check out [this article](https://www.theserverside.com/tutorial/What-Java-developers-need-to-know-about-TypeScript-syntax), which will give you a rundown on transitioning from Java to TypeScript
2. Read the quick [TypeScript basics](./typescript-intro.md) guide in this repository
3. Read/work through some of the [extra resources](#extra-resources) listed below. You may find some more helpful to you than others, find one that works for you!
4. Complete the [practice problems](#practice-problems)
5. Write some tests for your practice problems!

## I'm Familiar with TypeScript
- If you want a refresher, try out the [practice problems](#practice-problems) in this repository.
- You can also check out the [extra resources](#extra-resources) to refresh yourself.

## Practice Problems
There are practice problems in this repository (in the `practice-problems` directory). Complete these problems, and write some of your own tests for them!\
I have also written solutions to these practice problems (you guessed it, in the `solutions` directory) if you want to check your solutions.

- I provided sample tests for `objects.ts` in `solutions/objects.test.ts`
- We will ask students to write their own unit tests! Get familiar with it.
  
## Extra Resources
